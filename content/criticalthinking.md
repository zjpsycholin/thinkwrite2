## Critical Thinking (Weeks 1–2)
Use these notes to **preview** before class and **review** after class. You’ll see key ideas, quick checkpoints, and short practice tasks.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes 

By the end of this unit you should be able to:

- **Define** critical thinking and name the core **intellectual standards**: clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, logical correctness, completeness, fairness.  
- **Explain benefits** of critical thinking for decision-making and study.  
- **Spot barriers**: egocentrism/sociocentrism, unwarranted assumptions & stereotypes, relativistic thinking, wishful thinking.  
- **Differentiate** warranted vs. unwarranted assumptions and recognize stereotypes as a kind of hasty generalization.  
- **Apply a rational-acceptance guide** to decide when it is reasonable to accept a premise or claim.

## 1) What is Critical Thinking?

Critical thinking is a set of **skills and dispositions** for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating arguments and claims; overcoming biases; giving **convincing reasons**; and making **reasonable decisions** about what to believe and do.

**Intellectual Standards** we will use all semester:

- **Clarity** • **Precision** • **Accuracy** • **Relevance** • **Consistency** • **Logical correctness** • **Completeness** • **Fairness**  
  - Example prompt: “What makes this sentence unclear, and how would you rewrite it more clearly?”

**Why it matters:** Critical thinking balances constructive **skepticism** with appropriate **trust** so you can judge what’s likely true or effective.

---

## 2) Core Moves: Claim → Reason → Evidence

- A **claim** is what the writer or speaker wants you to accept.  
- **Reasons/evidence** support that claim.  
- Ask: *Are the reasons true? Do they **logically** support the conclusion?*

> **Checkpoint (self-test):** Underline the claim and circle two reasons in a short paragraph you choose (news/op-ed/blog). Add one **counter-reason** the writer overlooked.

---

## 3) Barriers to Good Thinking (Know Them to Beat Them)

Common barriers include **egocentrism**, **sociocentrism**, **unwarranted assumptions & stereotypes**, **relativistic thinking**, and **wishful thinking**.

- **Assumptions**: things we take for granted **without proof**; they can be **warranted** (reasonable) or **unwarranted** (poorly supported).  
- **Stereotypes**: a common **unwarranted assumption** formed by **hasty generalization** (small sample → big conclusion).  
- **Relativistic thinking** (“truth is just opinion”) can make critical evaluation seem pointless—avoid this trap.

> **Mini-practice:** List **two assumptions** behind a campus rumor or social-media claim you’ve heard. Label each **warranted** or **unwarranted** and give one reason for your judgment.

---

## 4) When is it Reasonable to Accept a Claim?

Use the **Principle of Rational Acceptance**:

> It’s reasonable to accept a claim if (1) it doesn’t conflict with trustworthy **personal experience**, (2) it doesn’t conflict with trustworthy **background beliefs**, and (3) it comes from a **credible source**.

Keep in mind how our **experiences** can mislead us (lighting, fatigue, expectations) and how **background beliefs** can be unreliable.

> **Quick check:** A friend says, “It snowed in Las Vegas last July.” Which parts of the guide help you evaluate this?

---

## 5) Benefits of Critical Thinking (for Students & Writers)

- Make **better decisions** about what to believe and do.  
- Evaluate the **strength of arguments** and guide readers logically to your conclusion when you write.  
- Present reasons **clearly, consistently, and in logical order**.

---

## 🔍 Preview Tasks (Before Class)

1) Preview the notes. Think of real-life examples.  
2) Read the supplementary chapter.

---

## 🧪 In-Class Micro-Activities (We’ll Do Variations of These)

- **Clarity Sprint:** Rewrite a dense sentence into one clearer sentence; name which standard you improved.  
- **Assumption Hunt:** Given a short claim (e.g., a social-media post), identify **two assumptions** and label each as warranted/unwarranted with one reason.

---

## 🔁 Review & Self-Check (After Class)

**A. Standards Quiz (self-marking)**  
Match the situation to the standard:

1) An argument has true premises but the reasoning doesn’t really connect them to the conclusion → **?**  
2) A paragraph wanders off topic with extra stories → **?**  
3) A sentence is so abstract that readers can’t tell what it means → **?**

<details><summary>Show answers</summary>

1) **Logical correctness**  
2) **Relevance**  
3) **Clarity**

</details>

**B. Short Reflection**  
- Which barrier is strongest for you right now? What *specific* step will you try next week to counter it? (e.g., seek a counter-example; ask “what assumption am I making?”).

## Output Task — Critical Thinking Mini Analysis

**Goal:** Apply our core moves — **claim → reason → evidence**, intellectual standards (clarity, relevance, logical correctness, etc.), and the **rational acceptance** guide — to make a well-reasoned judgment.


### 🧩 Your Task

Choose **one** of the following **claims** *or* select a short text (150–300 words) from a reputable news/op-ed/blog:

**Claim options (pick one):**
1. *Universities should require a logic & argument course for all undergraduates.*  
2. *Smartphone-free zones improve learning outcomes on campus.*  
3. *AI writing tools can help non-native speakers learn faster.*

Produce a **2-part submission**:

#### Part A — Argument Snapshot (bulleted)
- **Claim:** (state it clearly in your own words)  
- **Reasons (≥2):** list the author’s reasons *or* the most common reasons you’ve seen/heard  
- **Evidence (quotes, data, examples):** note briefly; if using your own example, label it as such  
- **Assumptions (≥2):** mark **W** warranted or **U** unwarranted (1 short justification each)  
- **Counter-argument (≥1)** + your **brief response**

#### Part B — Mini Analysis (300–450 words)
Evaluate the claim using **intellectual standards**:
- **Clarity & Precision:** Is the claim specific enough to evaluate?  
- **Relevance & Sufficiency:** Do the reasons/evidence actually support the claim? Are they enough?  
- **Logical Correctness:** Do the reasons *logically* lead to the conclusion? Any leaps?  
- **Fairness:** Did you consider a serious objection?

End with a **reasoned judgment** using the **rational acceptance** guide:
> **Verdict:** Accept / Reject / Suspend judgment — **because** … (1–2 sentences)


### 🧭 Format & Submission
- Use clear headings: **Part A** and **Part B**.  
- If you analyze an external text, include its **title/URL** (one line).  
- Length: **300–450 words** for Part B (Part A is bullet points).  
- File type: PDF or Markdown.  
- Due: **Start of Week 3** (before class).


### ✅ Checklist (self-review before you submit)
- [ ] I underlined the **claim** and gave **≥2 reasons**.  
- [ ] I identified **≥2 assumptions** and labeled them **W/U** with a reason.  
- [ ] I evaluated **relevance** and **logical connection** (not just truth).  
- [ ] I considered **one real counter-argument** fairly.  
- [ ] I stated a clear **verdict** (accept/reject/suspend) *and why*.  
- [ ] (If used) I included an **AI Use Statement**.


### 🔎 Scoring Guide (10 points)
- **Identification (3):** clear claim; ≥2 reasons; evidence noted.  
- **Evaluation (3):** applies standards (clarity, relevance, logical correctness, fairness).  
- **Reasoned Judgment (2):** justified accept/reject/suspend using rational acceptance.  
- **Organization & Style (2):** coherent, concise, accurate English.
