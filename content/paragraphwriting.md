# ✍️ Paragraph Writing (Weeks 3-4)

This week we **transition into writing**: clear, well-structured **paragraphs** are the building blocks of effective essays. We draw on three course readings:

- **Resource 1 — Paragraph Structure:** parts of a paragraph; topic sentence & controlling idea; model “gold” paragraph; concluding sentence use. [Link to Resource 1](/CTEW2/pdfs/Ch1ParagraphStructure.pdf) 
- **Resource 2 — Unity & Coherence:** unity; four coherence tools; transitions; logical order; sample revisions.  [Link to Resource 2](/CTEW2/pdfs/Ch2UnityandCoherence.pdf) 
- **Resource 3 — Supporting Details:** examples, statistics, quotations; integrating outside sources; reporting verbs; connecting evidence to claims.[Link to Resource 3](/CTEW2/pdfs/Ch3SupportingDetails.pdf)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of Week 3, you can:
- Explain the **three parts of a paragraph** (topic sentence, supporting sentences, concluding sentence). *(Resource 1: “Parts of a paragraph”)*  
- Write a **topic sentence** that names a topic **and** a **controlling idea** (specific focus). *(Resource 1: “Topic sentence & controlling idea”)*  
- Maintain **unity** (one main idea; stay on topic). *(Resource 2: “Unity” section)*  
- Achieve **coherence** using four tools: **repeat key nouns**, **use consistent pronouns**, **use transition signals**, **arrange sentences in logical order**. *(Resource 2: “Coherence tools”)*  
- Support ideas with **specific details** and **explain the connection** to the point. *(Resource 3: “Types of support” & “Make the connection”)*  
- Use a **concluding sentence** appropriately without adding new ideas. *(Resource 1: “Concluding sentence”)*

---

## 1) The Core: Topic Sentence → Support → (Optional) Conclusion
- A **topic sentence** states the **topic** and the **controlling idea** (the specific angle you will develop). See the *gold* model for how a controlling idea narrows focus. *(Resource 1)*  
- **Supporting sentences** explain or prove the topic sentence with concrete detail (e.g., “First of all… For example… Another…”). *(Resource 1)*  
- A **concluding sentence** signals the end and reinforces the main point; avoid introducing new ideas. *(Resource 1)*

> **Drafting frame:** **TS** (topic + controlling idea) → **Support 1** (specific detail) → **Support 2** (specific detail) → **(Optional) Conclusion** (restate main point).


## 2) Topic Sentences: Clear Focus with a Controlling Idea
- Good topic sentences are **complete**, contain **topic + controlling idea**, and are **neither too general nor too specific**. *(Resource 1: “What a topic sentence should/shouldn’t do”)*  
- **Position:** usually first, but may appear at the end or after examples; be consistent within an assignment. *(Resource 1: “Position of topic sentence”)*  
- Avoid **multiple unrelated controlling ideas**—that signals the need for more than one paragraph. *(Resource 1/2, notes on scope and unity)*

**Preview drill:** Write **3** topic sentences for **“campus study spaces”**, each with a different **controlling idea** (e.g., accessibility / noise levels / after-9 p.m. availability). Then choose the best one and explain why (clarity, precision). *(Resource 1)*


## 3) Unity: One Main Idea All the Way Through
- **Unity** means every sentence **directly supports** the topic + controlling idea; off-topic sentences break unity. *(Resource 2: “Unity”)*  
- If a sentence doesn’t support the main idea, **cut it** or **move it** to a more suitable paragraph. *(Resource 2)*

**Unity trim (in class):** Underline the topic sentence in a sample paragraph; cross out any off-topic sentence; propose a fix. *(Resource 2 exercises)*


## 4) Coherence: Make Sentences “Hold Together”
Use at least two of these when revising: *(Resource 2: “Coherence tools”)*  
1) **Repeat key nouns** (don’t hide your main subject).  
2) **Use consistent pronouns** (avoid vague “it/they”).  
3) **Use transition signals** deliberately (sequence, contrast, cause, example).  
4) **Arrange sentences in a clear pattern** (see §5).

> **Tip:** If a pronoun chain gets vague, repeat the **key noun** or use a **precise synonym**. *(Resource 2 examples)*


## 5) Logical Order — Your Reader’s GPS
Choose the order that fits your **purpose**: *(Resource 2: “Logical order” with models)*
- **Chronological** (steps/time) — e.g., a short process like “how to grow an avocado seed.”  
- **Logical division of ideas** (Part A, Part B…) — see the *gold* paragraph: beauty then utility.  
- **Comparison/Contrast** (similarities/differences) — e.g., “stingy vs. frugal” meaning/usage.

You can **combine** orders, but keep the pattern visible to the reader. *(Resource 2)*


## 6) Transition Signals: Use, Don’t Abuse
- Transitions clarify relations (sequence, contrast, cause, example). Overuse creates clutter; keep only those that genuinely guide the reader. *(Resource 2: “Transitions” list & cautions)*  
- Common **conclusion signals:** *Finally, Therefore, Thus, To sum up, In brief, In conclusion, In short, Indeed*. *(Resource 1/2 lists)*


## 7) Supporting Detail: Be Specific and Connect It
- **Specifics** include **examples, statistics, quotations**. *(Resource 3: “Types of support”)*  
- When using outside sources, **identify the source** (reporting verbs like *argues, reports, estimates, notes*) and **explain how** the evidence supports your point. *(Resource 3: “Reporting verbs” & “Make the connection”)*  
- Don’t “drop” numbers or quotes; **interpret** them for the reader. *(Resource 3)*

**Practice with data:** Take a simple chart (e.g., coffee cost breakdown). Write a paragraph with (1) a topic sentence stating the chart’s main idea; (2) 5–10 supporting statements using the numbers; (3) one reporting verb to attribute the data. *(Resource 3 practice)*


## 8) Conclusions: Signal the End, Don’t Add New Ideas
- In stand-alone paragraphs, a brief conclusion **signals closure** and **rephrases** the main point—no new information. *(Resource 1: “Concluding sentence”)*


## 9) Common Pitfalls & Quick Fixes
- **Vague topic sentence** → add a **controlling idea** (clear angle). *(Resource 1)*  
- **Too general/specific** → adjust scope of the topic sentence. *(Resource 1)*  
- **Off-topic sentences** → trim for **unity**. *(Resource 2)*  
- **Pronoun confusion** → repeat **key noun** or use a **clear synonym**. *(Resource 2)*  
- **Transition overload** → keep only helpful signals. *(Resource 2)*  
- **New idea in conclusion** → remove or move it earlier. *(Resource 1)*

## In-class Output - Week 3
### Paragraph Core Build (Topic Sentence • Unity • Basic Coherence)

**Time:** 20–25 minutes  
**Goal:** Produce one focused paragraph that demonstrates a clear **topic sentence + controlling idea**, **unity** (one main idea), and **basic coherence** (repeat key nouns; consistent pronouns).

### Prompt (choose ONE angle)
> **Campus study spaces** — Write about **one** controlling idea (e.g., *quiet*, *lighting*, *availability after 9 p.m.*, *seat reliability*).

### Requirements
- **Length:** 8–10 sentences (120–150 words).  
- **Topic sentence (TS):** includes the **topic** and a **controlling idea** that limits focus.  
- **Support:** 2–3 **specific** details (place/time/number/brief example).  
- **Unity:** every sentence directly supports the controlling idea (no side stories).  
- **Basic coherence:**  
  - **Repeat a key noun** (e.g., *the study space / the room*) at least **3** times.  
  - Use **consistent pronouns** for that noun (don’t switch referents).

### Mark-up (on your page)
- **Underline** your **TS**.  
- **[Box]** the **controlling idea** (the phrase in the TS).  
- **Bold** each repetition of your **key noun**.  
- *Italicize* pronouns that refer to it.  
- Put **[brackets]** around any sentence you suspect is off-topic.

### Sentence frames (optional)
- **TS:** “This campus study space is effective because ___ and ___.”  
- **Support:** “For example, ___.” / “In my experience, ___ at ___ (time/place).”  
- **Tie-back:** “These details show that ___ (restate controlling idea).”

### Deliverable
A clean paragraph with the required **mark-up** (paper or photo upload).

### Quick scoring (10 pts)
- TS + controlling idea clear **(3)** • Specific support **(3)** • Unity **(2)** • Basic coherence **(2)**

## In-class Output - Week 4
### Coherence & Support Workshop (Transitions • Order • Specifics)

**Time:** 25–30 minutes  
**Goal:** Build a paragraph that uses **coherence signals** (transitions + logical order) and integrates **specific support** (statistic/example/short quote with a reporting verb).

### Input (use these facts—don’t invent)
- Gate counts show **+18%** library use **after 9 p.m.** last term.  
- A quick poll of **52 students** found **55%** prefer reservable **study rooms**.  
- Prof. Chen **“warns about noise bleed”** in open areas.  
- The new learning center has **12** group rooms; average wait time **15 minutes** on weeknights.

### Choose ONE organizational pattern
- **Logical division of ideas** (e.g., *availability* + *noise control*)  
- **Comparison/contrast** (e.g., *library open area* vs. *reservable rooms*)  
- **Chronological/process** (e.g., *how to secure a reliable study spot after 9 p.m.*)

### Requirements
- **Length:** 9–11 sentences (140–170 words).  
- **Transitions:** use **≥3** varied signals (e.g., *first*, *however*, *for example*, *as a result*, *therefore*).  
- **Order:** keep a **clear, named pattern** (write it in the margin: *division* / *compare–contrast* / *chronological*).  
- **Support:** include **≥1 statistic** (with number), **≥1 concrete example**, and **1 short integrated quote (≤10 words)** using a **reporting verb** (*notes / reports / warns / estimates*).  
- **Conclusion:** close the paragraph; **no new information**.

### Mark-up (on your page)
- **Highlight** each transition signal.  
- Put **(DIV)** or **(C/C)** or **(CHRON)** at the end of the **TS** to label your pattern.  
- **[Bracket]** each statistic/quote/example.  
- Circle your **reporting verb**.

### Sentence frames (optional)
- **Compare/contrast:** “While ___ offers ___, ___ provides ___; however, ___.”  
- **Division:** “The space is effective for two reasons: ___ and ___.”  
- **Chronological:** “First, ___; next, ___; finally, ___, which results in ___.”  
- **Quote integration:** “As Chen **warns**, ‘___,’ so ___.”

### Deliverable
One paragraph using the **given data**, with the required **mark-up** (paper or photo upload).

### Quick scoring (10 pts)
- Clear order + transitions **(4)** • Correct, specific support **(4)** • Concluding sentence **(2)**
