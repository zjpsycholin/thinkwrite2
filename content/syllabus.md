## 📘 Course Description
This course refines academic writing with a strong focus on **argumentation**. Students learn to take clear positions, build logical reasoning, integrate credible evidence, address counter-arguments, and avoid fallacies. We also strengthen **paragraph writing** and **exposition** (illustration; comparison/contrast) as support skills, and engage critically with **writing in the age of AI**—especially for non-native speakers.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students can:

1. Plan and write well-structured argumentative essays (thesis, claims, support, counter-arguments).  
2. Produce coherent paragraphs (unity, topic sentences, logical development, cohesion).  
3. Apply exposition (illustration; comparison/contrast; definition; cause/effect) to support claims.  
4. Recognize, analyze, and evaluate arguments and evidence quality.  
5. Identify and avoid common logical fallacies.  
6. Use rhetorical strategies (ethos, pathos, logos) effectively.  
7. Locate, evaluate, and cite sources responsibly (summary, paraphrase, quotations).  
8. Use AI tools **responsibly and transparently** to support—rather than replace—original thinking and writing.  
9. Produce clear, accurate English prose (500–800 words per major essay).

## 🤖 Special Focus: Writing in the Age of AI (for Non-Native Speakers)
**Opportunities:** Brainstorming, language refinement, clarity/grammar feedback, generating counter-arguments to stress-test your stance.  
**Risks:** Plagiarism, overreliance, homogenized voice, shallow reasoning/unsupported claims.  
**Ethics & Integrity:** Disclose AI use; remain the **primary author**; verify facts; cite sources; never submit AI-only work.  

**Best Practices**
- Use AI for **support** (idea prompts, outline checks, language polishing).  
- Keep your **voice**: rewrite outputs in your own words, with your reasoning and examples.  
- **Fact-check** and **source** properly; attach an **AI Use Statement** to assignments when applicable.

---

## 🧪 Teaching Methods
- Mini-lectures & guided practice  
- Text analysis & critical reading  
- Workshops (draft → peer review → revision)  
- Debates/discussions on issues and arguments  
- Case studies (incl. AI-generated vs. human writing)  
- Short in-class writing for skill rehearsal
