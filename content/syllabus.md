## 📘 Course Description
This course refines academic writing with a strong focus on **argumentation**. Students learn to take clear positions, build logical reasoning, integrate credible evidence, address counter-arguments, and avoid fallacies. We also strengthen **paragraph writing** and **exposition** as support skills, and engage critically with **writing in the age of AI**—especially for non-native speakers.

Critical thinking skills practiced     
    •	Identifying claims, reasons, and evidence; distinguishing fact, opinion, and assumption    
    •	Applying intellectual standards: clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, logical correctness, completeness, fairness    
    •	Evaluating source credibility and evidence sufficiency; recognizing bias and logical fallacies     
    •	Constructing and testing counter-arguments; making reasoned judgments (accept / reject / suspend)     
    •	Translating analysis into coherent paragraphs and full argumentative essays     

思政融入（Ideological & Civic Literacy Integration）   
    •	以真实语篇为载体，培养价值判断与社会责任感：围绕校园与社会议题开展证据驱动的讨论    
    •	强调学术诚信与责任使用 AI：信息溯源、规范引用、原创性与透明度    
    •	练习理性表达与同理沟通：尊重多元观点，反对刻板印象与谬误推理   
    •	关注中国与全球发展相关主题（如教育公平、绿色发展、公共健康等），在写作中体现家国情怀与知行合一   

Outcome: By the end of the course, you will produce clear, well-supported argumentative writing that better meets academic standards, demonstrates ethical judgment, and contributes constructively to public discourse.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students can:

1. Plan and write well-structured argumentative essays (thesis, claims, support, counter-arguments).  
2. Produce coherent paragraphs (unity, topic sentences, logical development, cohesion).  
3. Apply exposition (illustration; comparison/contrast; definition; cause/effect) to support claims.  
4. Recognize, analyze, and evaluate arguments and evidence quality.  
5. Identify and avoid common logical fallacies.  
6. Use rhetorical strategies (ethos, pathos, logos) effectively.  
7. Locate, evaluate, and cite sources responsibly (summary, paraphrase, quotations).  
8. Use AI tools **responsibly and transparently** to support—rather than replace—original thinking and writing.  
9. Produce clear, accurate English prose (500–800 words per major essay).

## 🤖 Special Focus: Writing in the Age of AI (for Non-Native Speakers)
**Opportunities:** Brainstorming, language refinement, clarity/grammar feedback, generating counter-arguments to stress-test your stance.  
**Risks:** Plagiarism, overreliance, homogenized voice, shallow reasoning/unsupported claims.  
**Ethics & Integrity:** Disclose AI use; remain the **primary author**; verify facts; cite sources; never submit AI-only work.  

**Best Practices**
- Use AI for **support** (idea prompts, outline checks, language polishing).  
- Keep your **voice**: rewrite outputs in your own words, with your reasoning and examples.  
- **Fact-check** and **source** properly; attach an **AI Use Statement** to assignments when applicable.

## 🧪 Teaching Methods
- Mini-lectures & guided practice  
- Text analysis & critical reading  
- Workshops (draft → peer review → revision)  
- Debates/discussions on issues and arguments  
- Case studies (incl. AI-generated vs. human writing)  
- Short in-class writing for skill rehearsal

## 📜 Course Policies

### 1) Attendance & Participation
- Active engagement is expected. **unexcused** absences lower the final grade; >3 **unexcused** absences may result in a Fail grade.  
- Three late arrivals = one absence.

### 2) Submission & Late Work
- Submit on time by closely following instructions.  
- Late work: −1 grade step per day (e.g., B → B−). Work >7 days late may not be accepted.  
- Plan ahead; technical issues aren’t blanket excuses.

### 3) Academic Integrity & AI Use
- Plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration are prohibited.  
- **AI is allowed** for ideation, language support, and critique **with disclosure**. You must:  
  - remain the **primary author** of ideas, structure, and wording;  
  - provide an **AI Use Statement** describing what tools were used, how, and why;  
  - **fact-check** and **cite** all external sources (including those surfaced by AI).  
- Submitting AI-generated text as your own work is misconduct (grade = 0).

> **AI Use Statement — Example**
>>
>> **Assignment:** Essay 1 — “Should universities limit AI writing tools in first-year courses?”  
>>  
>> **Tools used:** ChatGPT (brainstorming & outline feedback); Grammarly (grammar/style suggestions).   
>> 
>> **How & why:**   
>> - Asked ChatGPT for three plausible counter-arguments and a critique of my outline’s clarity and logical order.
>> - Used one counter-argument to strengthen my rebuttal; reorganized two sections based on that feedback.
>> - Ran the final draft through Grammarly for surface-level grammar and punctuation checks.
>> 
>> **What I kept / changed:**
>> - Did **not** copy any sentences directly from ChatGPT.
>> - All claims, reasoning, and examples are **my own**; AI outputs served only as idea prompts and editing suggestions.
>> - Rewrote everything in my voice and added evidence from my cited sources.
>> 
>> **Verification:**
>> - Fact-checked all statistics and examples against the sources listed in my references.
>> - Removed any AI-suggested content that I could not verify.
>> 
>> **Scope:**
>> - Approximately **12% of sentences** lightly edited for grammar/style via Grammarly.
>> - No citations were generated by AI.
>> 
>> **Integrity:**
>> - This submission reflects my original thinking and wording. AI assistance was limited to brainstorming, structure feedback, and surface-level language polishing, consistent with course policy.

### 4) Classroom Conduct
- Laptops/phones for learning tasks only.  
- Respectful dialogue is mandatory—challenge ideas, not people.

<!--
### 5) Accessibility & Support
- Students needing accommodations should inform the instructor early.  
- Language-learning support is encouraged; use office hours and writing center resources.
