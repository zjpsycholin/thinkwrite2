---

## 👋 1) Getting to Know Each Other (warm-up)
- Brief self-intro (name, hometown/major interest).  
- One experience that shaped how you think or write in English.

## ✍️ 2) In-class Activity A — Writer’s Identity Micro-Argument
*A short activity to connect writing practice with critical thinking.*

**Task**  
- Write **3 sentences** that introduce you **as a writer** using a **micro-argument** structure:  
  1) **Claim** about yourself as a writer (one clear sentence).  
  2) **Reason 1** with a brief example.  
  3) **Reason 2** or a **mini counter-point + response** (e.g., a difficulty you’re working to overcome).  

An example:
 >I am a developing academic writer who clarifies my ideas by outlining before I draft. For example, I use a claim–reason–evidence map to plan each paragraph, which helped me cut unnecessary sentences in my history essay last term. Although I sometimes over-edit and lose momentum, I now set a timer and finish a full paragraph before revising, so my writing stays focused and fluent.


**Checklist**  
- Is your **claim** specific?  
- Do your **reasons** support the claim (not just repeat it)?  
- Did you include at least one **example**?  
- Underline the claim. Bold the strongest reason.

**Peer exchange (brief)**  
- Swap with a partner. Circle their claim; highlight one strong reason; suggest one clearer example.

**Why this matters**  
You’re already practicing the core moves of argumentation: **claim → reason → evidence / counter-response**.

## 🗂️ 3) Course Overview (syllabus highlights)
- What we’ll learn: **argument structure, exposition, logic, fallacies, counter-arguments, AI-aware writing**.  
- How you’ll learn: short practice → peer review → revision → portfolio.  
- How you’ll be graded: participation, assignments, two major essays, final exam + portfolio.

## 📝 4) Diagnostic Writing — *Writing, Me, and AI* (150–200 words)
**Prompt**  
> *Describe your writing experience and explain your view on writing in the age of AI.*  
> Include:  
> 1) **One formative writing experience** (what happened; what you learned).  
> 2) **Your current use (or non-use) of AI tools** (a concrete example).  
> 3) A clear **claim** about why learning to write is (or is not) still essential.  
> 4) **Two reasons** supporting your claim **and** **one counter-point + brief response**.  
> 5) **One goal** you set for yourself in this course (specific and measurable).

**Suggested structure**  
- **Opening (2–3 sentences):** your experience and claim.  
- **Body (5–7 sentences):** two reasons with a concrete example; one counter-point + response.  
- **Closing (1–2 sentences):** your course goal.

**Tone & integrity**  
Write in **your own voice**. If you mention facts or sources, summarize them in your words.
