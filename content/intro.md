## 👋 Getting to Know You — Name Tent

**Goal:** Help the instructor quickly learn names, pronunciations, and memorable facts—without repeating peer intros students already know.

**Name Tent**  
   Write:
   - **中文名** (large) 
   - **Preferred English name** (small)  
   - **One “memory hook”** word (e.g., badminton, Shandong, cats)

### What we keep
- **Name tents** (reuse for the next classes)

## 👋 Activity: Micro-Profile Card

**Goal:** Help the **instructor** quickly learn your name, pronunciation, interests, comfort level, and learning preferences—without long introductions.

### What you’ll do
**Complete the Micro-Profile Card (5–6′)**  
   Fill in the short form below. Be honest and brief.   
   Give your card to the instructor. Keep your **name tent** on your desk for the first 2–3 weeks.

### Micro-Profile Card 

MICRO-PROFILE

• English name | 中文名 + pinyin (tones):    
• Hometown / Region:    
• One fun fact (non-academic):    
• My comfort speaking English in class (circle):  1  2  3  4  5 (1 = very anxious • 5 = very comfortable)       
• I prefer being called on by:      
• One goal this term (short, specific):       
• AI tools I’ve tried (optional): __________________________       

> Tip: Short answers are fine. 


### What happens next
- The instructor keeps the **cards** (private).  
- We’ll use your preferences to shape participation and feedback.  
- Name tents remain on desks for the next few classes.



<!--
## 👋 1) Getting to Know Each Other (warm-up)
- Brief self-intro (name, hometown/major interest).  
- One experience that shaped how you think or write in English.

## ✍️ 2) In-class Activity A — Writer’s Identity Micro-Argument
*A short activity to connect writing practice with critical thinking.*

**Task**  
- Write **3 sentences** that introduce you **as a writer** using a **micro-argument** structure:  
  1) **Claim** about yourself as a writer (one clear sentence).  
  2) **Reason 1** with a brief example.  
  3) **Reason 2** or a **mini counter-point + response** (e.g., a difficulty you’re working to overcome).  

An example:
 >I am a developing academic writer who clarifies my ideas by outlining before I draft. For example, I use a claim–reason–evidence map to plan each paragraph, which helped me cut unnecessary sentences in my history essay last term. Although I sometimes over-edit and lose momentum, I now set a timer and finish a full paragraph before revising, so my writing stays focused and fluent.


**Checklist**  
- Is your **claim** specific?  
- Do your **reasons** support the claim (not just repeat it)?  
- Did you include at least one **example**?  
- Underline the claim. Bold the strongest reason.

**Peer exchange (brief)**  
- Swap with a partner. Circle their claim; highlight one strong reason; suggest one clearer example.

**Why this matters**  
You’re already practicing the core moves of argumentation: **claim → reason → evidence / counter-response**.

## 📝 4) Diagnostic Writing — *Writing, Me, and AI* (150–200 words)
**Prompt**  
> *Describe your writing experience and explain your view on writing in the age of AI.*  
> Include:  
> 1) **One formative writing experience** (what happened; what you learned).  
> 2) **Your current use (or non-use) of AI tools** (a concrete example).  
> 3) A clear **claim** about why learning to write is (or is not) still essential.  
> 4) **Two reasons** supporting your claim **and** **one counter-point + brief response**.  
> 5) **One goal** you set for yourself in this course (specific and measurable).

**Suggested structure**  
- **Opening (2–3 sentences):** your experience and claim.  
- **Body (5–7 sentences):** two reasons with a concrete example; one counter-point + response.  
- **Closing (1–2 sentences):** your course goal.

**Tone & integrity**  
Write in **your own voice**. If you mention facts or sources, summarize them in your words.
