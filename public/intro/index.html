## 👋 1) Getting to Know Each Other (warm-up)
- Brief self-intro (name, hometown/major interest).  
- One experience that shaped how you think or write in English.

---

## ✍️ 2) In-class Activity A — Writer’s Identity Micro-Argument
*A short activity to connect writing practice with critical thinking.*

**Task**  
- Write **3 sentences** that introduce you **as a writer** using a **micro-argument** structure:  
  1) **Claim** about yourself as a writer (one clear sentence).  
  2) **Reason 1** with a brief example.  
  3) **Reason 2** or a **mini counter-point + response** (e.g., a difficulty you’re working to overcome).  

An example:
 >I am a developing academic writer who clarifies my ideas by outlining before I draft. For example, I use a claim–reason–evidence map to plan each paragraph, which helped me cut unnecessary sentences in my history essay last term. Although I sometimes over-edit and lose momentum, I now set a timer and finish a full paragraph before revising, so my writing stays focused and fluent.


**Checklist**  
- Is your **claim** specific?  
- Do your **reasons** support the claim (not just repeat it)?  
- Did you include at least one **example**?  
- Underline the claim. Bold the strongest reason.

**Peer exchange (brief)**  
- Swap with a partner. Circle their claim; highlight one strong reason; suggest one clearer example.

**Why this matters**  
You’re already practicing the core moves of argumentation: **claim → reason → evidence / counter-response**.
