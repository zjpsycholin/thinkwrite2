<p>Use these notes to <strong>preview</strong> before class and <strong>review</strong> after class. You‚Äôll see key ideas, quick checkpoints, and short practice tasks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-learning-outcomes">üéØ Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this unit you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define</strong> critical thinking and name the core <strong>intellectual standards</strong>: clarity, precision, accuracy, relevance, consistency, logical correctness, completeness, fairness.</li>
<li><strong>Explain benefits</strong> of critical thinking for decision-making and study.</li>
<li><strong>Spot barriers</strong>: egocentrism/sociocentrism, unwarranted assumptions &amp; stereotypes, relativistic thinking, wishful thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiate</strong> warranted vs. unwarranted assumptions and recognize stereotypes as a kind of hasty generalization.</li>
<li><strong>Apply a rational-acceptance guide</strong> to decide when it is reasonable to accept a premise or claim.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-what-is-critical-thinking">1) What is Critical Thinking?</h2>
<p>Critical thinking is a set of <strong>skills and dispositions</strong> for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating arguments and claims; overcoming biases; giving <strong>convincing reasons</strong>; and making <strong>reasonable decisions</strong> about what to believe and do.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Standards</strong> we will use all semester:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Precision</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Accuracy</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Relevance</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Consistency</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Logical correctness</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Completeness</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Fairness</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example prompt: ‚ÄúWhat makes this sentence unclear, and how would you rewrite it more clearly?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Critical thinking balances constructive <strong>skepticism</strong> with appropriate <strong>trust</strong> so you can judge what‚Äôs likely true or effective.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-core-moves-claim--reason--evidence">2) Core Moves: Claim ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Evidence</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>claim</strong> is what the writer or speaker wants you to accept.</li>
<li><strong>Reasons/evidence</strong> support that claim.</li>
<li>Ask: <em>Are the reasons true? Do they <strong>logically</strong> support the conclusion?</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Checkpoint (self-test):</strong> Underline the claim and circle two reasons in a short paragraph you choose (news/op-ed/blog). Add one <strong>counter-reason</strong> the writer overlooked.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-barriers-to-good-thinking-know-them-to-beat-them">3) Barriers to Good Thinking (Know Them to Beat Them)</h2>
<p>Common barriers include <strong>egocentrism</strong>, <strong>sociocentrism</strong>, <strong>unwarranted assumptions &amp; stereotypes</strong>, <strong>relativistic thinking</strong>, and <strong>wishful thinking</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assumptions</strong>: things we take for granted <strong>without proof</strong>; they can be <strong>warranted</strong> (reasonable) or <strong>unwarranted</strong> (poorly supported).</li>
<li><strong>Stereotypes</strong>: a common <strong>unwarranted assumption</strong> formed by <strong>hasty generalization</strong> (small sample ‚Üí big conclusion).</li>
<li><strong>Relativistic thinking</strong> (‚Äútruth is just opinion‚Äù) can make critical evaluation seem pointless‚Äîavoid this trap.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mini-practice:</strong> List <strong>two assumptions</strong> behind a campus rumor or social-media claim you‚Äôve heard. Label each <strong>warranted</strong> or <strong>unwarranted</strong> and give one reason for your judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-when-is-it-reasonable-to-accept-a-claim">4) When is it Reasonable to Accept a Claim?</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Principle of Rational Acceptance</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs reasonable to accept a claim if (1) it doesn‚Äôt conflict with trustworthy <strong>personal experience</strong>, (2) it doesn‚Äôt conflict with trustworthy <strong>background beliefs</strong>, and (3) it comes from a <strong>credible source</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind how our <strong>experiences</strong> can mislead us (lighting, fatigue, expectations) and how <strong>background beliefs</strong> can be unreliable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quick check:</strong> A friend says, ‚ÄúIt snowed in Las Vegas last July.‚Äù Which parts of the guide help you evaluate this?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-benefits-of-critical-thinking-for-students--writers">5) Benefits of Critical Thinking (for Students &amp; Writers)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make <strong>better decisions</strong> about what to believe and do.</li>
<li>Evaluate the <strong>strength of arguments</strong> and guide readers logically to your conclusion when you write.</li>
<li>Present reasons <strong>clearly, consistently, and in logical order</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-preview-tasks-before-class">üîç Preview Tasks (Before Class)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity Sprint:</strong> Rewrite a dense sentence into one clearer sentence; name which standard you improved.</li>
<li><strong>Assumption Hunt:</strong> Given a short claim (e.g., a social-media post), identify <strong>two assumptions</strong> and label each as warranted/unwarranted with one reason.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="-review--self-check-after-class">üîÅ Review &amp; Self-Check (After Class)</h2>
<p><strong>A. Standards Quiz (self-marking)</strong><br>
Match the situation to the standard:</p>
<ol>
<li>An argument has true premises but the reasoning doesn‚Äôt really connect them to the conclusion ‚Üí <strong>?</strong></li>
<li>A paragraph wanders off topic with extra stories ‚Üí <strong>?</strong></li>
<li>A sentence is so abstract that readers can‚Äôt tell what it means ‚Üí <strong>?</strong></li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li><strong>Logical correctness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong></li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>B. Short Reflection</strong></p>

<li>Which barrier is strongest for you right now? What <em>specific</em> step will you try next week to counter it? (e.g., seek a counter-example; ask ‚Äúwhat assumption am I making?‚Äù).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="output-task--critical-thinking-mini-analysis">Output Task ‚Äî Critical Thinking Mini Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Apply our core moves ‚Äî <strong>claim ‚Üí reason ‚Üí evidence</strong>, intellectual standards (clarity, relevance, logical correctness, etc.), and the <strong>rational acceptance</strong> guide ‚Äî to make a well-reasoned judgment.</p>
<h3 id="-your-task">üß© Your Task</h3>
<p>Choose <strong>one</strong> of the following <strong>claims</strong> <em>or</em> select a short text (150‚Äì300 words) from a reputable news/op-ed/blog:</p>
<p><strong>Claim options (pick one):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Universities should require a logic &amp; argument course for all undergraduates.</em></li>
<li><em>Smartphone-free zones improve learning outcomes on campus.</em></li>
<li><em>AI writing tools can help non-native speakers learn faster.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Produce a <strong>2-part submission</strong>:</p>
<h4 id="part-a--argument-snapshot-bulleted">Part A ‚Äî Argument Snapshot (bulleted)</h4>

</ul>
<h4 id="part-b--mini-analysis-300450-words">Part B ‚Äî Mini Analysis (300‚Äì450 words)</h4>
<p>Evaluate the claim using <strong>intellectual standards</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity &amp; Precision:</strong> Is the claim specific enough to evaluate?</li>
<li><strong>Relevance &amp; Sufficiency:</strong> Do the reasons/evidence actually support the claim? Are they enough?</li>
<li><strong>Logical Correctness:</strong> Do the reasons <em>logically</em> lead to the conclusion? Any leaps?</li>
<li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Did you consider a serious objection?</li>
</ul>
<p>End with a <strong>reasoned judgment</strong> using the <strong>rational acceptance</strong> guide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Accept / Reject / Suspend judgment ‚Äî <strong>because</strong> ‚Ä¶ (1‚Äì2 sentences)</p>
