<h2 id="1-what-is-critical-thinking">1) What is Critical Thinking?</h2>
<p>Critical thinking is a set of <strong>skills and dispositions</strong> for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating arguments and claims; overcoming biases; giving <strong>convincing reasons</strong>; and making <strong>reasonable decisions</strong> about what to believe and do.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Standards</strong> we will use all semester:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Precision</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Accuracy</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Relevance</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Consistency</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Logical correctness</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Completeness</strong> ‚Ä¢ <strong>Fairness</strong>
<ul>
<li>Example prompt: ‚ÄúWhat makes this sentence unclear, and how would you rewrite it more clearly?‚Äù</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Critical thinking balances constructive <strong>skepticism</strong> with appropriate <strong>trust</strong> so you can judge what‚Äôs likely true or effective.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-core-moves-claim--reason--evidence">2) Core Moves: Claim ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Evidence</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>claim</strong> is what the writer or speaker wants you to accept.</li>
<li><strong>Reasons/evidence</strong> support that claim.</li>
<li>Ask: <em>Are the reasons true? Do they <strong>logically</strong> support the conclusion?</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Checkpoint (self-test):</strong> Underline the claim and circle two reasons in a short paragraph you choose (news/op-ed/blog). Add one <strong>counter-reason</strong> the writer overlooked.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-barriers-to-good-thinking-know-them-to-beat-them">3) Barriers to Good Thinking (Know Them to Beat Them)</h2>
<p>Common barriers include <strong>egocentrism</strong>, <strong>sociocentrism</strong>, <strong>unwarranted assumptions &amp; stereotypes</strong>, <strong>relativistic thinking</strong>, and <strong>wishful thinking</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assumptions</strong>: things we take for granted <strong>without proof</strong>; they can be <strong>warranted</strong> (reasonable) or <strong>unwarranted</strong> (poorly supported).</li>
<li><strong>Stereotypes</strong>: a common <strong>unwarranted assumption</strong> formed by <strong>hasty generalization</strong> (small sample ‚Üí big conclusion).</li>
<li><strong>Relativistic thinking</strong> (‚Äútruth is just opinion‚Äù) can make critical evaluation seem pointless‚Äîavoid this trap.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mini-practice:</strong> List <strong>two assumptions</strong> behind a campus rumor or social-media claim you‚Äôve heard. Label each <strong>warranted</strong> or <strong>unwarranted</strong> and give one reason for your judgment.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-when-is-it-reasonable-to-accept-a-claim">4) When is it Reasonable to Accept a Claim?</h2>
<p>Use the <strong>Principle of Rational Acceptance</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs reasonable to accept a claim if (1) it doesn‚Äôt conflict with trustworthy <strong>personal experience</strong>, (2) it doesn‚Äôt conflict with trustworthy <strong>background beliefs</strong>, and (3) it comes from a <strong>credible source</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind how our <strong>experiences</strong> can mislead us (lighting, fatigue, expectations) and how <strong>background beliefs</strong> can be unreliable.</p>

- **Clarity Sprint:** Rewrite a dense sentence into one clearer sentence; name which standard you improved.

## Output Task ‚Äî Critical Thinking Mini Analysis

**Goal:** Apply our core moves ‚Äî **claim ‚Üí reason ‚Üí evidence**, intellectual standards (clarity, relevance, logical correctness, etc.), and the **rational acceptance** guide ‚Äî to make a well-reasoned judgment.


### üß© Your Task

Choose **one** of the following **claims** *or* select a short text (150‚Äì300 words) from a reputable news/op-ed/blog:

**Claim options (pick one):**
1. *Universities should require a logic & argument course for all undergraduates.*  
2. *Smartphone-free zones improve learning outcomes on campus.*  
3. *AI writing tools can help non-native speakers learn faster.*

Produce a **2-part submission**:

#### Part A ‚Äî Argument Snapshot (bulleted)
- **Claim:** (state it clearly in your own words)  
- **Reasons (‚â•2):** list the author‚Äôs reasons *or* the most common reasons you‚Äôve seen/heard  
- **Evidence (quotes, data, examples):** note briefly; if using your own example, label it as such  
- **Assumptions (‚â•2):** mark **W** warranted or **U** unwarranted (1 short justification each)  
- **Counter-argument (‚â•1)** + your **brief response**

#### Part B ‚Äî Mini Analysis (300‚Äì450 words)
Evaluate the claim using **intellectual standards**:
- **Clarity & Precision:** Is the claim specific enough to evaluate?  
- **Relevance & Sufficiency:** Do the reasons/evidence actually support the claim? Are they enough?  
- **Logical Correctness:** Do the reasons *logically* lead to the conclusion? Any leaps?  
- **Fairness:** Did you consider a serious objection?

End with a **reasoned judgment** using the **rational acceptance** guide:
> **Verdict:** Accept / Reject / Suspend judgment ‚Äî **because** ‚Ä¶ (1‚Äì2 sentences)


### üß≠ Format & Submission
- Use clear headings: **Part A** and **Part B**.  
- If you analyze an external text, include its **title/URL** (one line).  
- Length: **300‚Äì450 words** for Part B (Part A is bullet points).  
- File type: PDF or Markdown.  
- Due: **Start of Week 3** (before class).


### ‚úÖ Checklist (self-review before you submit)
- [ ] I underlined the **claim** and gave **‚â•2 reasons**.  
- [ ] I identified **‚â•2 assumptions** and labeled them **W/U** with a reason.  
- [ ] I evaluated **relevance** and **logical connection** (not just truth).  
- [ ] I considered **one real counter-argument** fairly.  
- [ ] I stated a clear **verdict** (accept/reject/suspend) *and why*.  
- [ ] (If used) I included an **AI Use Statement**.


### üîé Scoring Guide (10 points)
- **Identification (3):** clear claim; ‚â•2 reasons; evidence noted.  
- **Evaluation (3):** applies standards (clarity, relevance, logical correctness, fairness).  
- **Reasoned Judgment (2):** justified accept/reject/suspend using rational acceptance.  
- **Organization & Style (2):** coherent, concise, accurate English.
